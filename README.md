# Wordlingo

Wordlingo is a word guessing game. Evey day, you get six tries to guess the word of the day.

This application is being built to share your Wording score with your friends. Other languages are going to be addeded, so you can guess the word in your second language having the word in the first language as a hint.

The original [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) was created by Josh Wardle in the end of 2021 and it was bought by The New York Times in January 2022. Since that, many versions have been created, in a varierity of languages. The Portugues version used in this project was created by [Gabtoschi](https://github.com/gabtoschi) and you can check his repository [here](https://github.com/gabtoschi/letreco).
